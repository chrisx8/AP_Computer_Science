/*
Write a program that uses BandBooster objects to track the sales of 2 band boosters over 3 weeks. Your program should
do the following:
- Read in the names of the two band boosters and construct an object for each.
- Prompt for and read in the number of boxes sold by each booster for each of the three weeks. Your prompts should include
the boosterâ€™s name as stored in the BandBooster object.
For example, Enter the number of boxes sold by Joe this week: For each member, after reading in the weekly sales, invoke
the updateSales method to update the total sales by that member.
- After reading the data, print the name and total sales for each member (you will implicitly use the toString method here).
